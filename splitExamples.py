text = ''' Haaga-Helia has stated that trips abroad for the work or study of staff and/or students may be considered, taking into account national and international safety regulations. As for the self-isolation and quarantine, you should check out the current instruction and recommendations of the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).

If you come to Finland from a country classified by THL as a risk area, you must remain in voluntary quarantine for 14 days. This applies to staff, students and guests alike. Passengers coming from the countries approved as safe by THL do not need to be quarantined.  '''
